description         A tool to build, deploy, and release any application on \
                    any platform

long_description    Waypoint allows developers to define their application \
                    build, deploy, and release lifecycle as code, reducing \
                    the time to deliver deployments through a consistent and \
                    repeatable workflow.  Waypoint supports a number of build \
                    methods and target platforms out of the box and more can \
                    be easily added via plugins: Cloud Native Buildpacks, \
                    Docker, Kubernetes, AWS EC2 and ECS, Azure Container \
                    Instances, Google Cloud Run, Netlify, and many more...
